A number $d_1d_0$ in base $b$ is equivalent to $d_1 \\\\cdot b^1 + d_0 \\\\cdot b^0$.\\n\\nApplying this to our numbers:\\n$17_b = 1 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = b+7$\\n$97_b = 9 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = 9b+7$\\n\\nFor these numbers to be valid in base $b$, the base $b$ must be greater than any of the digits used. In this case, the digits are 1, 7, and 9. Thus, we must have $b > 9$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\\n\\nThe problem states that $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. In algebraic terms, this means that $b+7$ is a divisor of $9b+7$. This can be written as:\\n$$ \\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7} = k $$\\nwhere $k$ must be an integer.\\n\\nTo determine when this expression is an integer, we can use polynomial long division or an algebraic manipulation. Let's rewrite the numerator in terms of the denominator, $b+7$:\\n$$ 9b+7 = 9(b+7) - 63 + 7 $$\\n$$ 9b+7 = 9(b+7) - 56 $$\\n\\nNow, substitute this back into the fraction:\\n$$ k = \\\\frac{9(b+7) - 56}{b+7} $$\\n\\nWe can split this fraction into two parts:\\n$$ k = \\\\frac{9(b+7)}{b+7} - \\\\frac{56}{b+7} $$\\n$$ k = 9 - \\\\frac{56}{b+7} $$\\n\\nFor $k$ to be an integer, the term $\\\\frac{56}{b+7}$ must also be an integer, since 9 is an integer. This implies that $b+7$ must be a divisor of 56.\\n\\nNow, we need to find all possible integer values for $b$. First, let's list the positive divisors of 56.\\nThe divisors of 56 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\\nSince the problem states that $b > 9$, we have a constraint on $b+7$:\\n$$ b > 9 \\\\implies b+7 > 9+7 \\\\implies b+7 > 16 $$\\n\\nSo, we are looking for the divisors of 56 that are greater than 16. From our list of divisors {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56}, the ones that satisfy this condition are 28 and 56.\\n\\nWe set $b+7$ equal to these values to find the possible values for $b$:\\nCase 1: $b+7 = 28$\\n$b = 28 - 7$\\n$b = 21$\\nThis value satisfies the condition $b>9$.\\n\\nCase 2: $b+7 = 56$\\n$b = 56 - 7$\\n$b = 49$\\nThis value also satisfies the condition $b>9$.\\n\\nThe integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$ are 21 and 49.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such integer bases $b$.\\nSum = $21 + 49 = \\\\boxed{70}$.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \"An elegant problem in number theory. As an IMO gold medalist, I see the path to the solution is a straightforward application of divisibility properties. Here's my approach.\\n\\nFirst, we must translate the problem from the language of number bases into a standard algebraic expression. The notation $d_n...d_1d_0_b$ represents the number $\\\\sum_{i=0}^n d_i b^i$.\\nThe number $17_b$ is equivalent to $1 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = b+7$ in base 10.\\nSimilarly, the number $97_b$ is equivalent to $9 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = 9b+7$ in base 10.\\nFor these numbers to be well-defined in base $b$, the base must be larger than any digit used. The digits are 1, 7, and 9. Thus, we must have $b>9$. The problem statement explicitly gives this condition, which confirms our understanding.\\n\\nThe problem states that $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. In our algebraic terms, this means $b+7$ divides $9b+7$. We can write this using the divisibility symbol as:\\n$b+7 \\\\mid 9b+7$.\\n\\nThe key insight here is to simplify this divisibility relation. We know that for any integer $k$, if $b+7$ divides an expression, it must also divide that expression plus or minus any multiple of $(b+7)$. This allows us to eliminate the variable $b$ from one side of the relation.\\nWe know that $b+7$ divides itself, so it must also divide any integer multiple of itself. Let's choose the multiple $9(b+7)$:\\n$b+7 \\\\mid 9(b+7) \\\\implies b+7 \\\\mid 9b+63$.\\n\\nNow we have two divisibility relations:\\n1) $b+7 \\\\mid 9b+7$\\n2) $b+7 \\\\mid 9b+63$\\nIf an integer divides two numbers, it must also divide their difference. So, $b+7$ must divide the difference between $(9b+63)$ and $(9b+7)$:\\n$b+7 \\\\mid (9b+63) - (9b+7)$\\n$b+7 \\\\mid 56$.\\n\\nThis simplifies the problem immensely.

The divisors greater than 16 are 28 and 56.\\n\\nThis leaves us with two possible cases for the value of $b+7$:\\nCase 1: $b+7 = 28$\\nSolving for $b$, we get $b = 28 - 7 = 21$.\\nThis value $b=21$ is an integer and satisfies $b > 9$. Thus, it is a valid base.\\n\\nCase 2: $b+7 = 56$\\nSolving for $b$, we get $b = 56 - 7 = 49$.\\nThis value $b=49$ is also an integer and satisfies $b > 9$. Thus, it is also a valid base.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such integer bases $b$. The valid bases we found are 21 and 49.\\nThe sum is $21 + 49 = 70$.\\n\\nTo be absolutely certain, let's verify our solutions.\\nFor $b=21$: $17_{21} = 21+7=28$ and $97_{21}=9(21)+7=189+7=196$. $196/28 = 7$. So 28 divides 196.\\nFor $b=49$: $17_{49} = 49+7=56$ and $97_{49}=9(49)+7=441+7=448$. $448/56 = 8$. So 56 divides 448.\\nBoth solutions are correct.\\n\\nThe sum of all valid integer bases $b$ is $21+49=70$.\\n\\n\\\\boxed{70}\",\n",

For this problem, the most reliable approach is to translate the numbers from base $b$ into a familiar algebraic form (base 10) and then use properties of divisibility.\\n\\n### The Chosen Method: Algebraic Translation and Simplification\\n\\nThis method is the most direct and reliable because it converts an unfamiliar problem in an arbitrary base $b$ into a standard number theory problem involving integers and fractions, which we have powerful tools to solve.\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\\n\\n### Step 1: Translate the numbers from base $b$ to base 10\\n\\nThe first step is to express the given numbers in our standard base-10 system. The notation $d_1 d_0_b$ is equivalent to $d_1 \\\\cdot b^1 + d_0 \\\\cdot b^0$.\\n\\n*   $17_b = 1 \\\\cdot b + 7 = b+7$\\n*   $97_b = 9 \\\\cdot b + 7 = 9b+7$\\n\\nFor these numbers to be valid, the base $b$ must be greater than any digit used. Since the digit '9' is used, we must have $b > 9$, which the problem already states.\\n\\n### Step 2: Set up the divisibility condition as an equation\\n\\nThe problem states that $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. Using our base-10 expressions, this means that $(b+7)$ must be a divisor of $(9b+7)$.\\n\\nIn other words, the fraction $\\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7}$ must be an integer. Let's call this integer $k$.\\nSo, $\\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7} = k$, where $k$ is some integer.\\n\\n### Step 3: Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression\\n\\nOur goal is to isolate $b$ or find a constraint on it. A very effective technique here is to rewrite the numerator in terms of the denominator. This is a form of polynomial division.\\n\\nWe can rewrite $9b+7$ as follows:\\n$\\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7} = \\\\frac{9(b+7) - 63 + 7}{b+7}$\\n\\nNotice that we changed $9b$ to $9(b+7)$, which equals $9b+63$. To keep the expression equivalent, we must subtract 63.\\n\\nNow, we can split the fraction:\\n$\\\\frac{9(b+7) - 56}{b+7} = \\\\frac{9(b+7)}{b+7} - \\\\frac{56}{b+7} = 9 - \\\\frac{56}{b+7}$\\n\\n### Step 4: Determine the condition for the expression to be an integer\\n\\nFor our expression $9 - \\\\frac{56}{b+7}$ to be an integer, the fractional part, $\\\\frac{56}{b+7}$, must also be an integer.\\n\\nThis is only possible if the denominator, $(b+7)$, is an integer divisor of the numerator, 56.\\n\\n### Step 5: Find all possible values of $b$\\n\\nSince $b+7$ must be a divisor of 56, we list all positive divisors of 56:\\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\\n(We don't need to consider negative divisors, because the problem states $b > 9$, which means $b+7$ must be positive).\\n\\nNow we can find the corresponding value of $b$ for each divisor by solving $b+7 = d$, or $b = d-7$. We must then check against the condition that $b>9$.\\n\\n*   $b+7=1 \\\\implies b = -6$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=2 \\\\implies b = -5$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=4 \\\\implies b = -1$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=7 \\\\implies b = 0$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=8 \\\\implies b = 1$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=14 \\\\implies b = 7$ (Not > 9)\\n*   $b+7=28 \\\\implies b = 21$ (This is a valid solution, as $21 > 9$)\\n*   $b+7=56 \\\\implies b = 49$ (This is also a valid solution, as $49 > 9$)\\n\\nSo, the only integer bases $b>9$ that satisfy the condition are 21 and 49.\\n\\n### Step 6: Calculate the final answer\\n\\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such integer bases $b$.\\nSum = $21 + 49 = 70$.\\n\\n\\\\boxed{70}\",\n",

We can rewrite the numerator in terms of the denominator:\\n$$9b+7 = 9b + 63 - 56 = 9(b+7) - 56$$\\nNow, we can substitute this back into the fraction:\\n$$\\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7} = \\\\frac{9(b+7) - 56}{b+7} = \\\\frac{9(b+7)}{b+7} - \\\\frac{56}{b+7} = 9 - \\\\frac{56}{b+7}$$\\nFor this expression to be an integer, the term $\\\\frac{56}{b+7}$ must be an integer.

Let\\'s list all the integer divisors of 56.\\nThe prime factorization of 56 is $2^3 \\\\cdot 7$. The positive divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. The negative divisors are -1, -2, -4, -7, -8, -14, -28, -56.\\n\\nSo, $b+7$ must be one of these 16 integers. This gives us $b = d - 7$ where $d$ is a divisor of 56.\\nThe problem specifies that $b$ is an integer base greater than 9, so we have the condition $b > 9$.\\nSubstituting $b = d-7$ into this inequality, we get:\\n$$d - 7 > 9$$\\n$$d > 16$$\\nWe now need to find which divisors $d$ of 56 are greater than 16.\\n\\nLet\\'s check the list of positive divisors: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56}.\\nThe divisors greater than 16 are 28 and 56.\\nLet\\'s find the corresponding values of $b$:\\n*   If $d = 28$: $b = 28 - 7 = 21$. This satisfies $b > 9$.\\n*   If $d = 56$: $b = 56 - 7 = 49$. This satisfies $b > 9$.\\n\\nNow consider the negative divisors: {-1, -2, -4, -7, -8, -14, -28, -56}.\\nThe largest of these is -1. If $d=-1$, then $b = -1-7=-8$, which is not greater than 9. Since all other negative divisors are even smaller, none of them will yield a value of $b$ that satisfies $b > 9$.\\n\\nThus, the only integer bases that satisfy all the problem\\'s conditions are $b=21$ and $b=49$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Calculate the sum of the valid bases**\\n\\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such integer bases $b$.

These are numbers written in base $b$. Let\\'s translate them into our familiar base-10 algebra.\\n*   $17_b = 1 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = b+7$\\n*   $97_b = 9 \\\\cdot b^1 + 7 \\\\cdot b^0 = 9b+7$\\n\\nThe problem states that for some integer base $b > 9$, $b+7$ is a divisor of $9b+7$. We can write this using mathematical notation as $(b+7) \\\\mid (9b+7)$.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s consider a few ways to solve this:\\n\\n1.  **Brute Force (Trial and Error):** We could start testing integer values of $b$ starting from $b=10$. For $b=10$, we check if $17$ divides $97$. It doesn\\'t. For $b=11$, we check if $18$ divides $106$. It doesn\\'t. This method is slow, tedious, and we have no way of knowing when we\\'ve found all the solutions. This is not a reliable strategy for a timed contest like the AIME.\\n\\n2.  **Algebraic Manipulation (Long Division):** We can treat this like a polynomial division. We want to know when the fraction $\\\\frac{9b+7}{b+7}$ results in an integer. We can rewrite the numerator to make the division obvious. This is a very strong approach.\\n\\n3.  **Number Theory Properties of Divisibility:** This is a closely related method to the algebraic one. The core idea is that if an integer $k$ divides two numbers, say $m$ and $n$, then it must also divide their difference, $m-n$. We can use this property to eliminate the variable $b$ and simplify the problem dramatically.\\n\\n### The Most Reliable Method\\n\\nThe most reliable and elegant method is a combination of approaches 2 and 3, which centers on a key number theory trick. By manipulating the expression that must be divisible, we can isolate a constant. This transforms the problem from one about a variable expression into a simple one about finding the divisors of a fixed number. This method is fast, efficient, and guarantees we will find all possible solutions.\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step solution using this method.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Step 1: Translate the problem into an algebraic expression.**\\n\\nFirst, we convert the numbers from base $b$ into expressions involving $b$.\\nThe number $17_b$ is equivalent to $1 \\\\cdot b + 7$.\\nThe number $97_b$ is equivalent to $9 \\\\cdot b + 7$.\\n\\nThe condition \"$17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$\" translates to the statement that the integer $(b+7)$ must divide the integer $(9b+7)$.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Step 2: Use divisibility properties to simplify the expression.**\\n\\nWe are given that $(b+7)$ divides $(9b+7)$.\\nWe also know that any number divides multiples of itself. Therefore, $(b+7)$ must divide $9 \\\\cdot (b+7)$.\\nExpanding this, we get that $(b+7)$ divides $(9b+63)$.\\n\\nNow we have two statements:\\n1. $(b+7) \\\\mid (9b+7)$ (given by the problem)\\n2. $(b+7) \\\\mid (9b+63)$ (a basic property)\\n\\nA fundamental rule of divisibility states that if an integer $k$ divides two integers $m$ and $n$, then $k$ must also divide their difference, $m-n$. Applying this rule here, $(b+7)$ must divide the difference between $(9b+63)$ and $(9b+7)$.\\n\\n$(9b+63) - (9b+7) = 56$.\\nSo, we have simplified the problem to the condition that $(b+7)$ must be a divisor of $56$.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Step 3: Find all possible values for the term $(b+7)$.**\\n\\nThis is now a straightforward task. We need to list all the integer divisors of 56. Since $b>9$, $b+7$ must be greater than $9+7=16$.
